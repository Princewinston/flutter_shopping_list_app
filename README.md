# Flutter Shopping List App 🛒

A simple and practical **shopping list mobile application** built using **Flutter** and **Firebase**.  
This app allows users to add and view shopping items while learning
**forms, validation, asynchronous programming, HTTP methods, Firebase integration,
loading states, and asynchronous data handling**.

---

## ✨ Features

- ➕ Add new shopping items using a form
- ✅ Form validation for clean input
- ⏳ Loading screen using `CircularProgressIndicator`
- 🌐 Backend connection using HTTP methods
- 🔥 Firebase Realtime Database used as a backend (for learning and practice)
- 🔄 Fetch and display data asynchronously from Firebase
- ❌ Basic error handling
- 🎨 Clean and simple Material UI

- Flutter Forms & `TextFormField`
- Form validation using validators
- Asynchronous programming with `Future` and `async/await`
- Handling loading and error states
- Managing asynchronous data and UI updates
- HTTP methods (`GET`, `POST`)
- Firebase backend integration
- Connecting frontend Flutter app to backend services
- Git & GitHub workflow
- Understanding how frontend Flutter apps interact with backend services
